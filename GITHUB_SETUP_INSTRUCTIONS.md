# üì§ GitHub Upload Instructions

## ‚úÖ Step 1-5: COMPLETED!
Your code is now committed and ready to push!

---

## üåê Step 6: Create GitHub Repository (Do This Now!)

### Go to GitHub and create a new repository:

1. **Click this link**: https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in the details**:
   - **Owner**: PinkSheepDog
   - **Repository name**: `tree-detection` (or choose your own name)
   - **Description**: `YOLOv7-based tree detection web application`
   - **Visibility**: Choose Public or Private

3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT - Leave these UNCHECKED**:
   - ‚ùå DO NOT add a README file
   - ‚ùå DO NOT add .gitignore
   - ‚ùå DO NOT choose a license
   
   (We already have these files!)

4. Click **"Create repository"** button

---

## üöÄ Step 7: Push Your Code

After creating the repository on GitHub, run these commands:

### Option A: If your repo name is "tree-detection"

```bash
cd /Users/ananyagulati/Desktop/tree-detection
git remote add origin https://github.com/PinkSheepDog/tree-detection.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Option B: If you chose a different repo name

Replace `YOUR-REPO-NAME` with your actual repository name:

```bash
cd /Users/ananyagulati/Desktop/tree-detection
git remote add origin https://github.com/PinkSheepDog/YOUR-REPO-NAME.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

## üîê Authentication

When you run `git push`, you'll be asked to authenticate. You have two options:

### Option 1: Using Personal Access Token (Recommended)

1. GitHub will open a browser window
2. Sign in to GitHub
3. Authorize Git Credential Manager
4. Done!

### Option 2: Using GitHub CLI (if installed)

```bash
gh auth login
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Large File (71MB model)

If the push fails because of the `best.pt` file (71MB), run:

```bash
cd /Users/ananyagulati/Desktop/tree-detection
./setup_git_lfs.sh
git add best.pt
git commit -m "Add model with Git LFS"
git push
```

---

## üìã Quick Command Summary

```bash
# 1. Create repo on GitHub (via web browser)

# 2. Add remote (replace with your repo name if different)
git remote add origin https://github.com/PinkSheepDog/tree-detection.git

# 3. Push your code
git push -u origin main

# 4. Done! ‚úÖ
```

---

## ‚úÖ After Successful Push

Once pushed, you can:
1. View your code at: `https://github.com/PinkSheepDog/tree-detection`
2. Proceed with deployment (see `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`)

---

## üí° Need Help?

If you get stuck:
- Check if you're logged into GitHub in your browser
- Make sure the repository name matches exactly
- If large file error, use Git LFS (see troubleshooting above)

**Ready to deploy after push!** üöÄ
