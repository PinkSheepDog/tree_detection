# ðŸŒ³ Tree Detection with YOLOv7

Detect and count trees in aerial/satellite imagery using YOLOv7 deep learning model.

## Features

- ðŸŽ¯ Accurate tree detection in aerial images
- ðŸ“Š Bounding box visualization
- ðŸ’¯ Confidence scores
- âš¡ Fast inference

## How to Use

1. Upload an image (aerial/satellite imagery preferred)
2. Click "Detect Trees"
3. View results with bounding boxes and statistics

## Model

This application uses YOLOv7, a state-of-the-art object detection model, fine-tuned for tree detection.

## Technology Stack

- YOLOv7 for object detection
- Gradio for the web interface
